Lean UX
	Come up with your 'Buyer persona' and hypothesis
	Develop your Lean UX Wireframe and Build a minimum viable product (MVP)
	Test, Analyze & Tweak
	Rapid-fire feedback from your target customers 
	iteration, rinse & repeat

In short, Create your wireframe based on your buyer persona, create your hypothesis, validate your hypothesis, test, learn, then repeat.

Lean UX is based on Lean Manufacturing that "avoids wastage"

A buyer persona is a research-based profile that depicts a target customer. Buyer personas describe who your ideal customers are, what their days are like, the challenges they face and how they make decisions.

For this, you’ll want to know who your users happen to be, what your product will be used for, when it will be used, the situations where your  offering will be used, the product’s most important features and functions, and the biggest risks to product acquisition and delivery.
