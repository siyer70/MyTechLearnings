Fundamentals

- CompletableFuture is used for asynchronous programming in Java.

- Asynchronous programming is a means of writing non-blocking code 
	- by running the task in a separate thread than in the main thread
	- and notifying the main thread about its progress
		- completion or failure
	- this way main thread 
		- does not get blocked / wait for the completion of task
		- can execute other task in parallel

- Having this kind of parallelism greatly improves the performance of the program
