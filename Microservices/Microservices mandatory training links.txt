Questions from Shivas

1.Is this all?, i.e. the complete course for Microservices in 3 phases or these are initial phases and more to come?  , as I see some more advanced topics/things that should be there currently missing,  like:
 
A. Best Practices while designing Microservices
B. Things to be kept in mind/approaches for converting a traditional Monolith application to Microservices Architecture
Will the above be covered in Phase 3 below?
 
C.CI/CD pipelines in Microservices Env. ,how to achieve robust CI/CD goals in a Microservices environment?
 
D. Orchestration in Microservices
 
E. Microservices Patterns
 
Let me know if there’s already a plan to cover these? Or are being covered in Phase 3 below?
