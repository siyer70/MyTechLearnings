ZAP
---
Personal Proxy 
	- It intercepts the http/https traffic between the browser and target
	- Similar to Burp Suite for this feature but works differently
Active & Passive Scanners
	- Passive Scanners just examines requests and responses
	- Passive does not perform any attacks
	- Active scanners does a range of attacks
		- Spidering / Crawling
		- Fuzzer
		- Generates Reports on the observed issues
		

Target
1. Application
2. Person
3. System

Information Gathering
======================
Passive
	(you don't interact with target host directly / anonymously)
	- Identifying IP addresses from sub-domain
	- Identifying external or third party sites
	- Identifying people related to the target
	- Identifying technologies
	- Identifying content of interest
	- Identifying vulnerabilities

	Sources: 
		- web / mail archives
		- social networking
		- search engines 


Active
	- Scan on the target systems

	- the fundamental difference between shodan and google is
		- shodan crawls internet
		- google crawls www
	- devices powered in www only make up a tiny part
	- thus Shodan gives a complete picture of the internet

- pipl.com (find info about people)
- checkusernames.com (nick names search)
	- finds people info in 160 social network sites

- web archives 

	- Internet archives (a San Fransisco based digital library)
		- state mission of "universal access to all knowledge"
		- free public access to collections of digitised materials
			- websites
			- software applications and games
			- music, movie, video, moving images
			- 3 million public domain books

- web.archive.org is the archive of websites
	- if you have published sensitive information accidently
		- and subsequently removed it (say after a week)
	- web.archive may still have that as it would have the old version

- Footprinting tools (FOCA)
	- is the technique used to 
		- gather information about computer systems
			- and the entities they belong to

		- capable of analysing documents
		- Desktop app
			- create a new project
				- specify the domain
				- folder and create button
			- under the network node, you can do the following
				- web search
				- dns search
				- dictionary search
				- ip bing 
					- to serve the domain name 
					- running on the same ip address

			- You can then scan for the site documents
			- then collect the interested documents
			- and extract meta data from those documents
			- from the meta data you can get to know the
				- employee name, email address etc

- Harvester
	- Gathers
		- Emails, subdomains, hosts
		- employee names, open ports, banners
		- from different public sources like 
			- search engines, pgp keys, shodan
		
	- use case
		harvester -g <domain name> -l <result limit> -d <datasource>
		- you can get to know
			- emails and hosts found

		- to check for vulnerabilities in the specified domain

Maltego
	- interactive data mining tool that renders 
		- directed graphs for link analysis
	- tool is used in online investigation for finding relationship
		- between pieces of information 
		- from various sources located on the internet
	- focus of Maltego is to analyse the real life relationships
		- between information that is publicly accessible in the net
	- includes
		- footprinting internet infrastructure
		- gathering information about the organization
		- can be used to determine the relationship 
			- between following entities
				- people, name email address, aliases
				- groups of people, organisations
				- websites, 
				- internet infrastructures

			- social networks, various online apis
			- extracted metadata

Input - Output Manipulation
===========================
- Same Origin Policy

- Input Validation
	- Negative data validation (allow script sources not in black list)
	- Positive data validation (allow script sources only in white list)
 
- XSS
	- Reflected and DOM based XSS
		- Occurs when server uses the user input for output
		- without validating the user input
		- processed immediately on the basis of user input
		- and results are reflected instantly to user.
		- nothing is stored permanently (or in db)
		- ex: search request and response
		
		- In this case, 
			- the attacker has to convince the victim one by one
			- he might do this by sending phishing emails
			- and lure the victim to click on the malicious link

		- DOM based XSS is subclass of Reflected XSS (work similar)
	- Stored XSS
		- In this case, the user input is stored in db
		- without validating the user input
		- Attack happens later when other user (victim) accesses that

		- ex: Blog pages where malicious script can be the comments
		- anyone subsequently visits the page 
		- and accesses the comments left earlier, becomes the victim

		- More harmful
			- As the attacker does not have to convince anyone
			- Everyone becomes the victim who accesses the blog
		
	

Authentication
==============

- hydra tool to crack userid and password online
- embedded in Kali
- burp suite

Captcha - Completely Automated Public Turing Test
to tell Computers and Humans Apart

Challenge-Response test used to determine whether or not the user is human

Captcha problems:
Weak Pictures/Algorithms
Limited set of possible answers
Encrypted by simple algorithm
Replay Attacks

- Dictionary is a common method to crack authentication
	- It maintains a list of easily guessable passwords
	- Many such dictionaries are available in the internet


Authorization attacks
=====================
1 - Unauthorized process
2 - Privilege Escalation
3 - Path Traversal

Unauthorized process - trying to perform actions not authorized for the current role / user.

Privilege Escalation
1) Horizontal (usera and userb have same privelege and usera accesses userb)
2) Vertical (usera access the privilege of admin user)

Path Traversal - trying to access parent folders of webroot or folders outside of webroot

Session Management and XSRF
===========================

Session Management techniques

Cookies (most popular method)
	- Cookie contains the session token
	- It gets generated when there is no session token in the cookie
	- Subsequent request to servers sends this cookie (session token)
	- Session token contains session id and other info
URL Rewriting
Hidden Form fields
Special HTTP headers
SSL Keys
