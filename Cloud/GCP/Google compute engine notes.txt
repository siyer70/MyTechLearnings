Compute Engine
- No upfront investment
- Consistent performance
- creating vm instance
	- use gcp console - for exploration
	- use gcloud 
	- use terraform for automation (IaC - Infra as code - best practice)

	- create vm instance directly by providing all params
		- pick a boot image (linux / windows)
		- specify cpus, ram / select gpus
		- persistent disks - standard / ssd
		- non-persistent option - local ssd (for temporary storage)
		- define start up scripts

	- create vm instance from template
	- create vm instance from image

	- preemptible instances (to save on cost)
		- especially used for long running batch analytical jobs

	- custom vms as per specific needs

	- scale up or scale out with compute engine

	- auto-scaling as per load


- snapshots of the vm
	- take disk snapshots as backups 
	- or as migration tools (for migrating vms from one region to another)
