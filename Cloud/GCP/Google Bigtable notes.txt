- NoSQL DB
- no rigid schema
- sparsely populated tables
	- with billion of rows
	- thousands of columns
	- petabytes of data
- fully managed service (no need to configure and tune it)
- some think of Bigtable as persistent hash tables
- ideal for storing large amounts of data with low latency
- supports high throughput - both read and write
	- so good choice for both operational and analytical applications eg:
		- IoT
		- user analytics
		- financial data analysis
- same open source API as HBase
	- Portability of applications between HBase and Bigtable
- behind the scene, bigtable manages the following for you:
	- adding machine count and rebalancing the data
	- upgrades and restarts transparently
	- all of the above without any downtime
	- data is encrypted in flight and at rest
	- IAM permissions to control who has access to data
- it is the same database that powers Google's core services such as
	- Search
	- Analytics
	- Maps
	- GMail
- part of GCP eco system
- data can be read and written to bigtable via
	- managed vms
	- HBase Rest Server
	- Java Server using HBase client
- data can also be streamed through popular streaming frameworks e.g:
	- Google Cloud Dataflow Streaming
	- Spark Streaming
	- Storm
- data can also be read and written to using Batch processes such as
	- Hadoop Map Reduce
	- Dataflow
	- Spark
