Cloud Migration Strategies (6 Rs)
01. Re Hosting - Lift and Shift
02. Re Platforming - Lift Tinker and Shift
	you might make a few cloud (or other) optimizations in order to achieve some tangible benefit, but you arenâ€™t otherwise changing the core architecture of the application
03. Re Purchasing - Moving to SaaS platform
	repurchasing is most commonly seen as a move to a SaaS platform. Moving a CRM to Salesforce.com, an HR system to Workday, a CMS to Drupal, and so on.
04. Re Designing / Re Architecting - Cloud Native Platform


05. Retire - See no value in Migrating
06. Retain - Legacy app that needs to be maintained, no value in Migrating
